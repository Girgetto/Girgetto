## 💭 Philosophy

```
while (alive) {
    eat();
    sleep();
    code();
    repeat();
}
```

I believe in:
- 📝 Clean, readable code over clever tricks
- 🤝 Collaboration and knowledge sharing
- 🐛 Learning from bugs (I've met plenty)
- 🔄 Continuous improvement
- ☕ The power of a good coffee break

## 🎲 Fun Facts

- 🔍 I've Googled "how to exit vim" more times than I'd like to admit
- 📚 My rubber duck is an excellent debugger (10/10 would recommend)
- 🌙 My best code happens at 2 AM (my sleep schedule disagrees)
- ⚡ I believe semicolons are optional... in JavaScript (don't @ me)
