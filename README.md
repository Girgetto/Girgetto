### Hi, I'm Giorgio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a big fan of the world of programming and technology. I put all of myself into every project I do, trying to bring my ideas to reality. I feel comfortable working in a group trying to inspire all my teammates. I began to study the basics of programming from high school, I continued my studies at the University of Florence. Moved to Madrid in 2017 to increase my knowledge in programming at IronHack where I work as Teacher's Assistant and from April 2019 part of the Guidesmiths team.
